### Congrats you have successfully installed Out-Of-Office! ðŸŽ‰

## How it works:
After submitting a leave request, both the manager (approver) and submitter will be notified of the submission. The request will populate the linked sheet and the approver can open the sheet at anytime to manage requests.

The approved column handles "yes" and "no". Blank cells or other text will be ignored. After approving and denying requests, the manager can press the schedule events tab and press the set time off button. Approved and denied rows will be processed and moved to the Archive sheet, all other rows will be ignored to be processed another time.

If approved, a new event will be created and the submitter will receive an approval email and calendar invite to their out of office. If denied, the submitter will receive a denied email.
